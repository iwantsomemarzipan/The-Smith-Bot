0,Reel Around the Fountain,"It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old
Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
Well, I wouldn't say no
People said that you were virtually dead
And they were so wrong
Fifteen minutes with you
Well, I wouldn't say no
People said that you were easily led
And they were half-right
They were half-right
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
It's time that the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old
Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
People see no worth in you
But I do
Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
People see no worth in you
I do, oh I do
I dreamt about you last night
And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly
But ""take me to the haven of your bed""
Was something that you never said
Two lumps, please
You're the bee's knees
But so am I
Meet me at the fountain
Shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Fifteen minutes with you
I wouldn't say no
People see no worth in you
But I do
Fifteen minutes with you
No, I wouldn't say no
People see no worth in you
I do, oh I do
Oh, I do
Oh, I do
Oh, I do"
1,You've Got Everything Now,"As merry as the days were long
I was right and you were wrong
Back at the old grey school
I would win and you would lose
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
Because I've never wanted one
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say…oh
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh…
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be seen…oh…in the back of your car
A friendship sadly lost?
Well this is true…and yet, it's false
Oh…
But did I ever tell you, by the way?
I never did like your face
But you've got everything now
You've got everything now
And what a terrible mess I've made of my life
Oh, what a mess I've made of my life
No, I've never had a job
Because I'm too shy
I've seen you smile
But I've never really heard you laugh
So who is rich and who is poor?
I cannot say…oh
Oh…
You are your mother's only son
And you're a desperate one
Oh…
But I don't want a lover
I just want to be tied… oh…to the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
To the back of your car
Oh…"
2,Miserable Lie,"So, goodbye
Please stay with your own kind
And I'll stay with mine
There's something against us
It's not time
It's not time
So, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I know I need hardly say
How much I love your casual way
Oh, but please put your tongue away
A little higher and we're well away
The dark nights are drawing in
And your humor is as black as them
I look at yours, you laugh at mine
And ""love"" is just a miserable lie
You have destroyed my flower-like life
Not once - twice
You have corrupt my innocent mind
Not once - twice
I know the wind-swept mystical air
It means : I'd like to see your underwear
I recognize that mystical air
It means : I'd like to seize your underwear
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
Just a rented room in Whalley Range
What do we get for our trouble and pain?
…Whalley Range !
Into the depths of the criminal world
I followed her…
I need advice, I need advice
I need advice, I need advice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
Nobody ever looks at me twice
I'm just a country-mile behind
The world
I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh…
I'm just a country-mile behind
The world
I'm just a country-mile behind
The whole world
Oh oh, oh…
Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh…
Take me when you go
Oh oh, oh…
I need advice, I need advice"
3,Pretty Girls Make Graves,"Upon the sand, upon the bay
""There is a quick and easy way"" you say
Before you illustrate
I'd rather state :
""I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am""
And sorrow's native son
He will not smile for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
Oh…
End of the pier, end of the bay
You tug my arm, and say : ""give in to lust,
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll
Soon be dust… ""
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am
I'm not the man you think I am
And sorrow's native son
He will not rise for anyone
And pretty girls make graves
Oh really?
Oh…
I could have been wild and I could have
Been free
But nature played this trick on me
She wants it now
And she will not wait
But she's too rough
And I'm too delicate
Then, on the sand
Another man, he takes her hand
A smile lights up her stupid face
(and well, it would)
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith in womanhood
I lost my faith…
Oh…
Hand in glove…
The sun shines out of our behinds…
Oh…"
4,The Hand That Rocks The Cradle,"Please don't cry
For the ghost and the storm outside
Will not invade this sacred shrine
Nor infiltrate your mind
My life down I shall lie
If the bogey-man should try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
To tease, torment, and tantalize
Wavering shadows loom
A piano plays in an empty room
There'll be blood on the cleaver tonight
And when darkness lifts and the room is bright
I'll still be by your side
For you are all that matters
And I'll love you to till the day I die
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Ceiling shadows shimmy by
And when the wardrobe towers like a beast of prey
There's sadness in your beautiful eyes
Oh, your untouched, unsoiled, wondrous eyes
My life down I shall lie
Should restless spirits try
To play tricks on your sacred mind
I once had a child, and it saved my life
And I never even asked his name
I just looked into his wondrous eyes
And said : ""never never never again""
And all too soon I did return
Just like a moth to a flame
So rattle my bones all over the stones
I'm only a beggar-man whom nobody owns
Oh, see how words as old as sin
Fit me like a glove
I'm here and here I'll stay
Together we lie, together we pray
There never need be longing in your eyes
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
As long as the hand that rocks the cradle is mine
Mine
Climb up on my knee, sonny boy
Although you're only three, sonny boy
You're - you're mine
And your mother she just never knew
Oh, your mother… 
As long…as long…as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
As long…as long…as long as…as long
I did my best for her
I did my best for her
Oh…"
5,This Charming Man,"Punctured bicycle
on a hillside desolate.
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car
this charming man.
Why pamper life's complexities
when the leather runs smooth
on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight.
but I haven't got a stitch to wear.
This man said ""It's gruesome
that someone so handsome should care"".
A jumped-up pantry boy
who never knew his place
he said ""Return the ring"".
He knows so much about these things.
He knows so much about these things.
I would go out tonight
but I haven't got a stitch to wear.
This man said ""It's gruesome

He knows so much about these things.
He knows so much about these things.

6,Still Ill,"I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine - it owes me a living
But ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
Oh, ask me why, and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh
Am I still ill?
Oh
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I dunno
Ask me why, and I'll die
Oh, ask me why, and I'll die
And if you must, go to work - tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know, because I've seen them
But not very often
Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh
Oh, am I still ill?
Oh"
7,Hand In Glove,"Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
No, it's not like any other love
This one is different - because it's us
Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care
Kiss my shades
Hand in glove
The good people laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they'll never have
And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, I really don't know and I really don't care
Kiss my shades…oh…
So, hand in glove I stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath
If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath
For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer
But I know my luck too well
Yes, I know my luck too well
And I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
Oh"
8,What Difference Does It Make?,"All men have secrets and here is mine, so let it be known
For we have been through hell and high tide
I can surely rely on you
And yet you start to recoil
Heavy words are so lightly thrown
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you
So what difference does it make?
So what difference does it make?
It makes none, but, now you have gone
And you must be looking very old tonight
The devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and I lied, and why? Because you asked me to
But now you make me feel so ashamed
Because I've only got two hands
Well I'm still fond of you, aha ho
So what difference does it make?
What difference does it make?
It makes none, but, now you have gone
And your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight
Oh, the devil will find work for idle hands to do
I stole and then I lied just because you asked me to
But now you know the truth about me
You won't see me anymore
Well I'm still fond of you, aha ho
But no more apologies
No more apologies
I'm too tired
I'm so sick and tired
And I'm feeling very sick and ill today
But I'm still fond of you, aha ho"
9,I Don't Owe You Anything,"Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next
Bought on stolen wine
A nod was the first step
You knew very well
What was coming next
Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say :
""Oh, I don't want to go out tonight""?
""Oh, I don't want to go out tonight""
Oh, but you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now
You should never go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do
You should not go to them
Let them come to you
Just like I do
Just like I do
Did I really walk all this way
Just to hear you say :
""Oh, I don't want to go out tonight""?
""Oh, I don't want to go out tonight""
But you will
For you must
I don't owe you anything, no
But you owe me something
Repay me now
Too freely on your lips
Words prematurely sad
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight
Life is never kind
Life is never kind
Oh, but I know what will make you smile tonight"
10,Suffer Little Children,"Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down
Over the moor, take me to the moor
Dig a shallow grave
And I'll lay me down
Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads
Oh John, you'll never be a man
And you'll never see your home again
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Edward, see those alluring lights?
Tonight will be your very last night
A woman said : ""I know my son is dead
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head""
Hindley wakes and Hindley says :
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says :
""Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone""
But fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Fresh lilaced moorland fields
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death
Hindley wakes and says :
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says :
""Oh, whatever he has done, I have done""
But this is no easy ride
For a child cries :
""Oh, find me…find me, nothing more
We are on a sullen misty moor
We may be dead and we may be gone
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side
Until the day you die
This is no easy ride
We will haunt you when you laugh
Yes, you could say we're a team
You might sleep
You might sleep
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !
Oh, you might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !""
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for
Oh, find me, find me !
Find me !
I'll haunt you when you laugh
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh
You might sleep
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !
Oh…
Over the moors, I'm on the moor
Oh, over the moor
Oh, the child is on the moor"
11,The Headmaster Ritual,"Belligerent ghouls run Manchester schools
Spineless swines, cemented minds
Sir leads the troops, jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't wanna stay
Give up education
As a bad mistake
Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbow in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates
I wanna go home
I don't wanna stay
Belligerent ghouls run Manchester schools
Spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops, jealous of youth
Same old jokes since 1902
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck
I wanna go home
I don't want to stay
Give up life
As a bad mistake
Please excuse me from gym
I've got this terrible cold coming on
He grabs and devours
He kicks me in the showers
Kicks me in the showers
And he grabs and devours
I want to go home
I don't want to stay"
12,Rusholme Ruffians,"The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed and his money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is Famous, she is Funny
An engagement ring
Doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass (money)
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait (on her mother's side)
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
Then someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
And someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And though I walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: ""How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?""

So scratch my name on your arm with a fountain pen
(This means you really love me)

13,I Want The One I Can't Have,"On the day that your mentality
Decides to try
To catch up with your biology
Come 'round
'Cause I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology
I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over, all over my face
A double bed
And a stalwart lover for sure
These are the richest of the poor
A double bed
And a stalwart lover for sure
These are the richest of the poor
And I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's all over, all over my face
A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails
Raised on Prisoner's Aid
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen
And somehow that really impressed me
And it's written all over my face
Oh, these are the richest of the poor
These are the richest of the poor
I want the one I can't have
And it's driving me mad
It's written all over my face
On the day that your mentality
Catches up with your biology
And if you ever need self-validation
Just meet me in the alley by the railway station
It's all over my face"
14,What She Said,"What she said:
""How come someone hasn't noticed
That I'm dead
And decided to bury me?
God knows, I'm ready !""
What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy
Could only be idiocy
What she said was not for the job or
Lover that she never had
Oh, No no no
What she read
All heady books
She'd sit and prophesize
(It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really really open her eyes)

15,That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore,"Park the car at the side of the road
You should know
Time's tide will smother you
And I will too
When you laugh about people
Who feel so very lonely
Their only desire is to die
Well, I'm afraid
It doesn't make me smile
I wish I could laugh
But that joke isn't funny anymore
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
It's too close to home
And it's too near the bone
More than you'll ever know
Kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
You kick them when they fall down
Kick them when they fall down
It was dark as I drove the point home
And on cold leather seats
Well, it suddenly struck me
I just might die with a smile on my face, after all
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine
I've seen this happen in other people's lives
And now it's happening in mine"
16,How Soon Is Now?,"I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and the heir of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human, and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
I am the son and the heir
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human, and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does
There's a club if you'd like to go
You could meet somebody who really loves you
So you go, and you stand on your own
And you leave on your own
And you go home, and you cry, and you want to die
When you say it's gonna happen now
Well, when exactly do you mean
See I've already waited too long
And all my hope is gone
You shut your mouth, how can you say
I go about things the wrong way
I am human, and I need to be loved
Just like everybody else does"
17,Nowhere Fast,"I'd like to drop my trousers to the world
I am a man of means (of slender means)
Each household appliance
Is like a new science in my town
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
And when a train goes by
It's such a sad sound, no, no…
It's such a sad thing
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen
Every sensible child will know what this means
The poor and the needy
Are selfish and greedy on her terms
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump in the ocean
And when a train goes by
It's such a sad sound, no, no…
It's such a sad thing
And when I'm lying in my bed
I think about life and I think about death
And neither one particularly appeals to me
And if the day came when I felt a natural emotion
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie
In the middle of the street and die
I'd lie down and die
Oh, oh"
18,Well I Wonder,"Well I wonder
Do you hear me when you sleep?
I hoarsely cry
Well I wonder
Do you see me when we pass?
I half died
Please keep me in mind
Please keep me in mind
Gasping, but somehow still alive
This is the fierce last stand of all I am
Gasping, dying, but somehow still alive
This is the final stand of all I am
Please keep me in mind
Well I wonder
Well I wonder
Please keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind"
19,Barbarism Begins at Home,"Unruly boys

20,Meat Is Murder,"Heifer whines could be human cries
Closer comes the screaming knife
This beautiful creature must die
This beautiful creature must die
A death for no reason
And death for no reason is MURDER
And the flesh you so fancifully fry
Is not succulent, tasty or kind
It's death for no reason
And death for no reason is MURDER
And the calf that you carve with a smile
It is MURDER
And the turkey you festively slice
It is MURDER
Do you know how animals die?
Kitchen aromas aren't very homely
It's not ""comforting"", cheery or kind
It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench
Of MURDER
It's not ""natural"", ""normal"" or kind
The flesh you so fancifully fry
The meat in your mouth
As you savour the flavour
Of MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT IS MURDER
NO, NO, NO, IT IS MURDER
Oh … and who hears when animals cry?"
21,The Queen Is Dead,"Farewell to this land's cheerless marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very lowness with her head in a sling
I'm truly sorry - but it sounds like a wonderful thing
Dear Charles, don't you ever crave
To appear on the front of the Daily Mail
Dressed in your mother's bridal veil?
So I checked all the registered historical facts
And I was shocked into shame to discover
How I'm the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other
Has the world changed or have I changed?
Has the world changed or have I changed?
As some 9-year old tough peddles drugs
(I swear I never even knew what drugs WERE)
And so, I broke into the Palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said, ""Eh, I know you and you cannot sing.""
I said, ""That's nothing - you should hear me play piano.""
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your mother's apron
No-one talks about castration
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
Like love and law and poverty
These are the things that kill me
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But the rain that flattens my hair
These are things that kill me
Past the Pub that saps your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The Queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Past the Pub that wrecks your body
And the church - all they want is your money
The Queen is dead, boys
You can trust me, boys
(life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely
life is very long, when you're lonely)"
22,"Frankly, Mr. Shankly","Frankly Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way but it corrodes my soul
I want to leave, you will not miss me
I want to go down in musical history
Frankly Mr. Shankly, I'm a sickening wreck
I've got the 21st century breathing down my neck
I must move fast, you understand me
I want to go down in celluloid history, Shankly
Fame, fame, fatal fame
It can play hideous tricks on the brain
But still I'd rather be famous
Than righteous or holy any day, any day, any day
But sometimes I'd feel more fulfilled
Making Christmas cards with the mentally ill
I want to live and I want to love
I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of
Frankly Mr. Shankly, this position I've held
It pays my way and it corrodes my soul
Oh, I didn't realize that you wrote poetry
I didn't realize you wrote such bloody awful poetry, Shankly
Frankly Mr. Shankly, since you ask
You are a flatulent pain the ass
I do not mean to be so rude
But still I must speak frankly, Mr. Shankly
Oh, give us money"
23,I Know It's Over,"Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go over…
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
See the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you
And I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go, over over over over…
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart, it was so real
And you even spoke to me and said:
""If you're so funny, then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever, then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining, then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good looking, why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, because tonight is just like any other night
It's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each others arms
It's so easy to love, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind, over over over over
It's so easy to love, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind, over over…
Love is natural and real
But not for you my love
Not tonight my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I, my love
Oh mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head
Mother I can feel the soil falling over my head
Oh mother I can feel the soil falling over my head,
Oh mother I can feel the soil falling over my head,
Oh mother I can feel the soil falling over my head."
24,Never Had No One Ever,"When you walk without ease
On these
Streets were you were raised
I had a really bad dream
It lasted 20 years, 7 months, and 27 days
I never, I'm alone, and I
Never, ever oh … had no one ever
Now I'm outside your house
I'm alone
And I'm outside your house
I hate to intrude …
Oh, Alone, I'm Alone, I'm Alone, I'm Alone
I'm Alone, I'm Alone
And I never, never … oh … had no one ever
I never had no one ever
I never had no, no one ever
Had no one never

25,Cemetry Gates,"A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people, all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves, and hates
And passions just like mine
They were born
And then they lived
And then they died
It seems so unfair
I want to cry
You say : ""'Ere thrice the sun done salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I've read well, and I've heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose/poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take ""on loan""
'Cause there's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall
You say : ""'Ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
And then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(Some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're happy
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Oh, Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So let's go where we're wanted
And I meet you at the cemetry gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
But you lose
'Cause weird lover Wilde is on mine
Sure !"
26,Bigmouth Strikes Again,"Sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when
I said I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt,
Now I Know how Joan of Arc felt,
As the Flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walk-man started to melt.

27,The Boy With The Thorn In His Side,"The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A murderous desire for love
How can they look into my eyes
And still they don't believe me?
How can they hear me say those words
Still they don't believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever believe me?
And if they don't believe me now
Will they ever, they ever, believe me?
Oh…
The boy with the thorn in his side
Behind the hatred there lies
A plundering desire for love
How can they see the Love in our eyes
And still they don't believe us?
And after all this time
They don't want to believe us
And if they don't believe us now
Will they ever believe us?
And when you want to live
How do you start?
Where do you go?
Who do you need to know?
Oh…
Oh no…
Oh…

28,Vicar In A Tutu,"I was minding my business
Lifting some lead off
The roof of the Holy Name church
It was worthwhile living a laughable life
To set my eyes on the blistering sight
Of a vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way
A scanty bit of a thing
With a decorative ring
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose
As Rose collects the money in a cannister
Who comes sliding down the bannister?
The vicar in a tutu
He's not strange
He just wants to live his life this way
The monkish monsignor
With a head full of plaster
Said : ""My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned""
As Rose counts the money in the cannister
As natural as Rain
He dances again
My god !
The vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh …
The vicar in a tutu
Oh yeah
Oh …
The next day in the pulpit
With Freedom and Ease
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease
As Rose counts the money in the cannister
As natural as Rain
He dances again and again and again
In the fabric of a tutu
Any man could get used to
And I am the living sign
And I'm a living sign
I am a living sign
I'm a living sign
I am a living sign
I'm a living sign
Sign …
I am a living sign"
29,There Is A Light That Never Goes Out,"Take me out tonight

And they're young and alive
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people, and I want to see light
Driving in your car, oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more
And if a double decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the priveledge is mine
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And in a darkened under-pass
I thought, oh God, my chance has come at last
But then a strange fear gripped me, and I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car, I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, oh, I haven't got one
And if a double decker bus crashes into us
To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the priveledge is mine
Oh, there is a light, and it never goes out
There is a light, and it never goes out
There is a light, and it never goes out

Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay
And general decay
Nature must still find a way
So ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way
This way, that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Let your puny body, lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out and…
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say :
Will the world end in the night time?
(I really don't know)
Or will the world end in the day time?
(I really don't know)
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're here and it's now
So…stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you consciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Oh…"
51,"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want","Good times for a change
See the luck I've had, can make a good man turn bad
So please please please let me
Let me, let me, let me get what I want this time
I haven't had a dream in a long time
See the life I've had, can make a good man bad
So, for once in my life, let me get what I want
Lord knows it would be the first time
Lord knows it would be the first time"
52,This Night Has Opened My Eyes,"In a river the color of lead
Immerse the baby's head
Wrap her up in the News Of The World
Dump her on a doorstep, girl
This night has opened my eyes
And I will never sleep again
You kicked and cried like a bullied child
A grown man of twenty-five
Oh, he said he'd cure your ills
But he didn't and he never will
Oh, save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
A shoeless child on a swing
Reminds you of your own again
She took away your troubles
Oh, but then again
She left pain
So, please save your life
Because you've only got one
The dream has gone
But the baby is real
Oh, you did a good thing
She could have been a poet
Or, she could have been a fool
Oh, you did a bad thing
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh …
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad
Oh …
And I'm not happy
And I'm not sad"

55,A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours,"Hello…
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
hung by his pretty white neck
some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
and I missed my bed
and I soon came home
they said:
""there's too much caffeine
in your blood stream
and a lack of real spice
in your life""
I said:
""leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
surprised to still be on my own….""
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again
urrrrrrggghh a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so it shall be again
and people who are uglier than you and I
they take what they need, and just leave
Ooh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
urrrrggghh a rush and a push and the land that
we stand on is ours
it has been before
so why can't it be now?
and people who are weaker than you and I
they take what they want from life
Ooh, but don't mention love
no no-don't mention love!
urrrggghhh a rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
your youth may be gone
but you're still a yound man
so phone me, phone me, phone me
so phone me, phone me, phone me
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Urrgh, I think I'm in lerv"
56,I Started Something I Couldn't Finish,"The lanes were silent:
there was nothing, no one, nothing around for miles
I doused our friendly venture
with a hard-faced,
three-word gesture
I started something, I forced you to a zone and you were clearly
never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me, typical me, I started something
…and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means!
And I doused another venture
with a gesture that was absolutely vile
I started something, I forced you to a zone and you were clearly
never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me, typical me, I started something
…and now I'm not too sure
I grabbed you by the guilded beams
Uh, that's what tradition means!
And now eighteen months' hard labour seems…
… fair enough
I started something and I forced you to a zone and you were clearly
Never meant to go
Hair brushed and parted
Typical me, typical me, typical me, I started something
and now I'm not too sure
I started something
I started something
Typical me, typical me, typical me, typical me
typical me, typical me, typical me
I started something and now I'm not too sure!"

58,Girlfriend In A Coma,"Girlfriend in a coma, I know, I know, it's serious,
Girlfriend in a coma, I know, I know, it's really serious.
There were times when I could have murdered her,
But you know I would hate anything to happen to her,
No I don't want to see her.
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Do you really think she'll pull through?
Doohoo ohoo oo hoo
Girlfriend in a coma, I know, I know, it's serious,
My, my, my, my, my, my baby, you're mine.

Would you please let me see her.

59,Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before,"Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
…Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love
I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said lied I'd to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied because I never? I never!
Who said I'd lied because I never?
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my spleen
And broke my knee
(and then he really laced into me)
Friday night in out-patients
Who said I'd lied to her?
Oh, who said I'd lied? - Because I never, I never
Who said I'd lied? - Because I never
Oh, so I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor…
…I drank more
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
…Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love"
60,Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me,"Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope no harm
Just another false alarm
Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm
So, tell me how long
Before the last one?
And tell me how long
Before the right one?
The story is old - I know
But it goes on
The story is old - I know
But it goes on
Oh, goes on
And on
Oh, goes on
And on"
61,Unhappy Birthday,"I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday
because you're evil
and you lie
and if you should die
I may feel slightly sad
(but I won't cry)
Loved and lost
and some may say
when usuallly its Nothing
surely you're happy
it should be this way?
I say ""No, I'm gonna kill my dog""
""May the lines sag heavy
and deep tonight ""
I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday

Loved and lost

so, drink, drink, drink
and be ill tonight
from…. the one you left behind
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind
from the one you left behind
behind (X6)
Oh unhappy birthday

62,Paint A Vulgar Picture,"At the record company meeting
On their hands - a dead star
And oh, the plans they weave
And oh, the sickening greed
At the record company party
On their hands - a dead star
The sycophantic slags all say :
""I knew him first, and I knew him well""
Re-issue ! Re-package ! Re-package !
Re-evaluate the songs
Double-pack with a photograph
Extra Track (and a tacky badge)
A-list, playlist
""Please them , please them !""
""Please them !""
(sadly, THIS was your life)
But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have said no
If you'd wanted to
BPI, MTV, BBC
""Please them ! Please them !""
(sadly this was your life)
But you could have said no
If you'd wanted to
You could have walked away
Couldn't you?
I touched you at the soundcheck
You had no real way of knowing
In my heart I begged ""Take me with you …
I don't care where you're going…""
But to you I was faceless
I was fawning, I was boring
Just a child from those ugly new houses
Who could never begin to know
Who could never really know
Oh …
Best of Most of
Satiate the need
Slip them into different sleeves
Buy both, and feel deceived
Climber - new entry, re-entry
World tour ! (""media whore"")
""Please the Press in Belgium !""
(THIS was your life…)
And when it fails to recoup?
Well, maybe :
You just haven't earned it yet, baby
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck
You're just the same as I am
What makes most people feel happy
Leads us headlong into harm
So, in my bedroom in those 'ugly new houses'
I danced my legs down to the knees
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again …
At the record company meeting
On their hands - at last ! - a dead star !
But they can never taint you in my eyes
No, they can never touch you now
No, they cannot hurt you, my darling
They cannot touch you now
But me and my 'true love'
Will never meet again"
63,Death At One's Elbow,"Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight

Who really really loves you
Oh Glenn
Stay home
Be bored
(It's crap, I KNOW)
Tonight
Oh Glenn
Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Oh Glenn
Oh Glenn
Don't come to the house tonight
Because there's somebody here
Who'll take a hatchet to your ear
The frustration it renders me
Hateful, oh …
Oh, don't come to the house tonight
Oh, don't come to the house tonight
Because you'll slip on the
Trail of all my sad remains
That's why, that's why

GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE
GOODBYE MY LOVE, GOODBYE MY LOVE"
64,I Won't Share You,"I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And ambition
The zeal I feel
This is my time
The note I wrote
As she read, she said
""Has the Perrier gone
Straight to my head
Or is life sick and cruel, instead?""
""YES !""
No - no - no - no - no - no
No - no - no - no - no - no
Oh …
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time
Life tends to come and go
That's OK
As long as you know
Life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
With the drive
And the dreams inside
This is my time
I want the freedom and I want the guile
I want the freedom and the guile
Oh, life tends to come and go
As long as you know
Know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
Oh …
I won't share you, no
I won't share you
I'll see you somewhere
I'll see you sometime
